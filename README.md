# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains a reinforcement learning project focused on the CartPole problem. The objective of the CartPole environment is to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the cart. This project utilizes two key reinforcement learning algorithms: SARA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) and Q-Learning.
